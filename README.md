# Qcore-Student-Forum

Qcore is a Student forum which involves students where they can ask queries and get answered by their own college friends. Day to Day problems varying from mess food to the classroom environment to co-curricular activities to sports in college can be asked by students. Students are provided with their separate branches where they can ask branch-specific queries. Students also have a profile where they can manage their account.
